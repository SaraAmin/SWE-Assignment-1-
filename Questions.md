## Q1:
  A Class Is a block of code that defines a set of elements and functions performing an event with specified properties which can be inherited by objects defined by this Class.

## Q2:
  A Class defines abstraction by naming a set of elements and functions by an only name, the class name. And events performed by that class can be called using that name. for the encapsulation as it organize and categorize the events into named functions that can be hidden by declaring them as private or unhidden by declaring them as public and the public functions can be called outside of that class.

## Q3:
  An Object is what inherits all its properties and elements and functions. its an instance of that class.

## Q4:
  Class Functions perform a certain event but Data members are spaces in memory.

## Q6:
  A class Constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
  A Destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

## Q8:
  Default Constructor doesnâ€™t have any parameters and they exist to initialize the data members of a class.

## Q10:
  this is a pointer and *this is a dereferenced pointer. If you had a function that returned this it would be a pointer to the current object while a function that returned *this would be a clone of the current object allocated on the stack unless you have specified the return type of the method to return a reference.
