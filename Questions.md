## Q1:
  class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object.

## Q2:
  A Class defines abstraction by naming a set of elements and functions by an only name, the class name. And events performed by that class can be called using that name. for the encapsulation as it organize and categorize the events into named functions that can be hidden by declaring them as private or unhidden by declaring them as public and the public functions can be called outside of that class.

## Q3:
  an object is a specific instance of a class. It contains real values instead of variables.

## Q4:
  Class Functions perform a certain event but Data members are spaces in memory.

## Q6:
  A class Constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed when new objects of that class are  created.
  A Destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class.

## Q8:
  Default Constructor doesnâ€™t have any parameters and they exist to initialize a class' data members.

## Q10:
  this is a pointer and *this is a dereferenced pointer. If you had a function that returned this it would be a pointer to the current object while a function that returned *this would be a clone of the current object allocated on the stack unless you have specified the return type of the method to return a reference.
